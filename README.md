For the "Hardware and Software" course in 2019

This project show how to control a 8x8 LED matrix (MAX7219) with a DE1-SoC. We use the Software Quartus II on wich we develop our Driver and Application.
We wanted to represent the switching of complex emotions of a human being trhough the (un)fortunate events of life. Our 8x8 LED Matrix will display either a sad or a happy smiley depending of a switch position.
